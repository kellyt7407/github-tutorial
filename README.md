## Git vs. GitHub
***Git:***
- version control; keeps *"snapshots"* of the code
-  Doesn't require Github
-  Runs on command line  

***Github:***
- Store code in cloud
- Visually track changes
- Easily collaborate on files
- Requires Git

## Workflow & Commands
***Basic Workflow***
1. Initial Repository (if there's no existing project)  
   -OR-  
fork/clone, push/pull
2. Edit file
3. Add file by using *git add .* or *git add <file>*
4. Commit the change by using *git commit -m "commit message"*
5. Then push the changes to local repo if needed by using *git push*  
- **git diff**: see the difference between your current code and the previous commit
- **git log**: see past commits
- **git pull**: bring any change from the remote repo "down" to local
- **git status**: lets you see which changes have been staged
- **..**: go up to parent directory
- **~**: goes to the root directory
- **(tab)**: auto complete a word
- ***git init***: initializes git in our directory (now called a repository) for version control
